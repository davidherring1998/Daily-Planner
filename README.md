When the user opens the planner the user presented with the current day and time at the top of the page.  When they scroll down the user scrolls down they will see time blocks for standard business hours color coded for the  past (light-blue), present (red), and the future (green).  When the user clicks into the time block input and adds an event, it creates a list item that is saved into local storage. At the bottom of the page, the user has the option to view their event history.  When the page is refreshed, the events remain saved in local storage.
